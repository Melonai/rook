Secure secret and file sharing using WebRTC.

### Running locally

Before starting please ensure that you have both [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html) and [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) installed.

To quickly set up all dependencies needed by both the server and the client run:

```sh
$ mix setup
```

To then run the app, run either:

```sh
$ mix phx.server
```

or

```sh
$ iex -S mix phx.server
```

to get an interactive IEx session.

Have fun!
